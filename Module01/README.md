Module description

## Task Inspirations

- Something with smart power plugs (e.g. switching on/off based on current electricity price)
- Ambient light sensor controlling a smart bulb

## Task Personal Profile
Relevant expertise is limited; I dabbled with Arduino, breadboards and basic LED circuits around ~2012, later on I benefited from the experience preparing to solder some relatively basic circuits onto perfoboards. Personal greatest achievement related to programming MCUs is making LED circuits act in various funny ways.


## Task What is IoT
I missed the first half of the masterclass, so the following is very much improvised.

Domains and included areas:

- Home automation
- Agriculture
- Military
- Manufacturing and more


Commonly used (data) protocols:

- MQTT
- Bluetooth
- Wi-Fi
- etc

Typical devices (appliance or micro controller):

-  ESP32
-  Smart lightbulbs
-  Anything Arduino
-  Power plugs
-  Imagination is the limit?

Challenges:

-  Security
-  Personal capabilites?
-  Network related issues
