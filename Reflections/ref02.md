Tinkering with breadboards was fun, as well as the quick recap on basic electronics.
My first experience with something like this was back when I was a wee lad in middle school and m father got himself one of the earlier Arduino models.
I remember making a row of red LEDs move like KITT's light in Knight Rider.
I also did a lot of breadboarding when I was prototyping a theremin schematic I was trying to build in high school.
I look forward to polishing my rusty skills in coming classes.
This time I partnered up with Rico-Andreas, and we ran into no more trouble than a broken RGB LED.
