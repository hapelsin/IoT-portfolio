# Reflection 1 in Module 1
	
Not being familiar with Node-RED (and missing the first half of the class) made following along a bit difficult. I didn't expect to learn visual programming in this course, but welcome the opportunity. The cheerful and charismatic professor definitely made the class fun to participate in. Mimie shared in my struggles with grasping Node-RED on the go. I should make sure to prepare in advance for the coming practicals.
