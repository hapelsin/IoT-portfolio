Starting with independent research and presentations was surprisingly fun (and educational), considering I don't usually like these kinds of spontaneous presentations.
A little bit more time might have been nice, but this is probably due to RS232 going over my head.
Much like the previous class, hands on learning was good fun. Voltage divider circuits could maybe be explained in a bit more detail beforehand,
or maybe our attempt's unexplainably erratic behaviour is the source of my frustrations instead.
The instructors were very helpful and managed to help us over all the major hurdles though.
This time I partnered with Agnes Kivistik, who also presented our findings on RS232.
